### Prameya – Objects of Knowledge in Nyaya Shastra

  

#### 1. **Recap of Lecture 2**

- We previously explored **Pramana** as the foundational means to acquire valid knowledge, covering its four types: **Perception, Inference, Comparison, and Verbal Testimony**.

- This session will focus on the second category of Nyaya’s sixteen padarthas: **Prameya (Objects of Knowledge)**.

  

#### 2. **Introduction to Prameya**

-  **Prameya** refers to the entities or objects that are knowable through pramanas.

- Nyaya Shastra identifies **twelve core prameyas**, which include fundamental elements of reality as understood through epistemological inquiry.

- Prameya is crucial for understanding the **ontological framework** of Nyaya philosophy, as it reveals the components of reality.

  

#### 3. **The Twelve Prameyas (Objects of Knowledge)**

- The Nyaya Sutra enumerates twelve prameyas, which are:

1.  **Atman (Soul)**

2.  **Sharira (Body)**

3.  **Indriya (Senses)**

4.  **Artha (Objects of Senses)**

5.  **Buddhi (Intellect)**

6.  **Manas (Mind)**

7.  **Pravritti (Activity)**

8.  **Dosha (Fault)**

9.  **Pretyabhava (Rebirth/Transmigration)**

10.  **Phala (Fruit/Result)**

11.  **Duhkha (Pain)**

12.  **Apavarga (Release/Liberation)**

- These prameyas together represent the **entire domain of knowledge** and are the objects that an individual must understand correctly to attain liberation (moksha).

  

#### 4. **Detailed Explanation of Each Prameya**

  

##### 4.1 **Atman (Soul)**

-  **Definition**: Atman is the **eternal, conscious self** that is distinct from the body, senses, and mind.

- Characteristics:

- It is the **substratum of consciousness** and the basis of personal identity.

- The soul is marked by qualities like **desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, and intelligence**.

- It undergoes transmigration based on karmic activities but seeks liberation (apavarga) as its ultimate goal.

- Nyaya argues for the soul’s existence based on experiences of **memory, cognition, and continuity of identity**.

  

##### 4.2 **Sharira (Body)**

-  **Definition**: The body is the **physical structure** that serves as the site of perception, action, and experiences like pleasure and pain.

- Role:

- It is the medium through which the soul interacts with the physical world.

- It enables the operation of senses and activities that are necessary for survival and knowledge acquisition.

  

##### 4.3 **Indriya (Senses)**

-  **Definition**: Senses are the instruments that enable the perception of external objects.

- Types:

- Nyaya identifies five senses: **Nose (Smell), Tongue (Taste), Eye (Sight), Skin (Touch), and Ear (Sound)**.

- Relation to Elements:

- Each sense corresponds to one of the **five elements** (earth, water, fire, air, ether).

  

##### 4.4 **Artha (Objects of Senses)**

-  **Definition**: Artha refers to the **objects** that are perceived through the senses.

- Categories:

- Artha includes qualities like **smell, taste, color, touch, and sound**, which correspond to the senses.

- These objects are qualities of the **five great elements** (Pancha Mahabhuta), making them central to perceptual knowledge.

  

##### 4.5 **Buddhi (Intellect)**

-  **Definition**: Buddhi is the **faculty of intellect or knowledge**, responsible for decision-making, reasoning, and discernment.

- Role:

- It helps in distinguishing between **truth and error**.

- It processes information provided by the senses and the mind, leading to conceptual understanding.

  

##### 4.6 **Manas (Mind)**

-  **Definition**: Manas is the **internal organ** that facilitates mental functions such as thinking, willing, and reasoning.

- Characteristics:

- It is atomic in nature, enabling **focus on a single object** at a time, thus preventing simultaneous perception.

- Nyaya distinguishes the mind from the soul, treating it as an intermediary between the senses and the intellect.

  

##### 4.7 **Pravritti (Activity)**

-  **Definition**: Pravritti refers to the **effort or action** that leads to fulfilling desires or aversions.

- Types:

- It includes physical, verbal, and mental actions.

- It plays a key role in the **causal chain** that influences karma, affecting rebirth and experiences in future lives.

  

##### 4.8 **Dosha (Fault)**

-  **Definition**: Dosha signifies **mental flaws or moral defects** that lead to attachment, aversion, and ignorance.

- Three Main Doshas:

1.  **Raga (Attachment)**

2.  **Dvesha (Aversion)**

3.  **Moha (Delusion/Confusion)**

- These faults are considered the primary causes of **suffering and bondage**, keeping the soul trapped in the cycle of rebirth.

  

##### 4.9 **Pretyabhava (Rebirth/Transmigration)**

-  **Definition**: Pretyabhava refers to the **cycle of rebirth** that the soul undergoes due to past karmas.

- Nyaya emphasizes the cyclic nature of existence, where the soul is reborn until liberation is attained.

- The doctrine of rebirth is supported by evidence from **memory of past lives, dreams, and intuitive experiences**.

  

##### 4.10 **Phala (Fruit/Result)**

-  **Definition**: Phala denotes the **results or outcomes** of actions, whether good (punya) or bad (papa).

- It includes immediate and long-term consequences that manifest in the current or future lives of the soul.

  

##### 4.11 **Duhkha (Pain)**

-  **Definition**: Duhkha is defined as **pain, suffering, or dissatisfaction**, which is the result of karma.

- Nyaya Shastra identifies pain as the central problem of existence, which drives the soul’s search for liberation.

- Pain can be physical, mental, or existential, encompassing all forms of discomfort.

  

##### 4.12 **Apavarga (Release/Liberation)**

-  **Definition**: Apavarga is the ultimate goal of life—**liberation from the cycle of birth and death**.

- It signifies the **cessation of all suffering**, achieved through the true knowledge of pramanas and prameyas.

- Liberation involves the **elimination of faults (doshas)** and cessation of karma, allowing the soul to exist in a state of pure consciousness.

  

#### 5. **Philosophical Significance of Prameya**

- Prameya represents Nyaya’s **ontological commitment**, defining reality as perceived through pramanas.

- Understanding prameya helps to **contextualize** the process of liberation, as it involves discerning the true nature of existence through correct knowledge.

  

#### 6. **Nyaya’s Unique Ontology**

- While Nyaya shares certain categories with other Indian philosophical systems (e.g., Samkhya and Vaisheshika), its distinct emphasis is on **logical verification** of these entities.

- Prameya serves as both the **goal of inquiry** and the **pathway to moksha**, making it central to Nyaya’s epistemological framework.

  

#### 7. **Conclusion**

- This lecture focused on the twelve **prameyas**, detailing their characteristics, significance, and role in the Nyaya system.

- A firm understanding of prameya is necessary for comprehending the full scope of Nyaya's logical inquiry and its broader philosophical implications.
